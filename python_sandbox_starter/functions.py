# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In Python, we do not use parentheses and curly brackets, we use indentation with tabs or spaces





# def sum(a, b):
#     return (a + b)

# a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
# b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

# print(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')



def sayHello(name):
    print(f'Hello {name}')
    
sayHello('Rohito')


def getSum(num,num2):
    total = num + num2
    return total

print(getSum(1,3))

x= 10
y = 40

if x > y : print('x is greater than Y') 
else : print('x is nOt greater than Y') 

print(f'x {x} and y {y}')


if x > y : print('x is greater than Y') 
elif x == y : print('x is equal to Y') 
else:   print('x is NOT greater than Y') 








# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Very similar to JS arrow functions
